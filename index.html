<body><br>How the Web Works</br>

<p><b>HTML</b>
<br>HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>.
HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
HTML documents contain <i>text content</i> which describes "what you see" and <i>markup</i> which describes "how it looks". 
</p

<p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b><br>
HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. 
When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
You don't need to memorize all the different elements and tags because they are easily accessible on the web.
</p>

<p><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<br>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
</p>
<p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b><br>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. 
Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p></body>
